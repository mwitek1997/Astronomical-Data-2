With data collected from the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer(PdBI), which is now part of the Northern Extended Millimeter Array(NOEMA), we were provided with
observations of ULIRGs which are Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies. In total we took four sets of ULIRG observations, this was two sets of ultraluminous infrared
galaxies. Meaning two observations of CO(1-0) lines, and two observations of CO(2-1) lines. With the given files, iras15250co10.uvf, iras15250co21, iras17208co10.uvf, 
and iras17208co21.uvf, we set out to determine the following:

1. Key properties of the spectral axis of each dataset provided.
2. Range of velocities relative to systemic redshift over which each galaxy shows CO emission.
3. Whether each data set shows evidence of continuum emission, and if so how to correct the estimates of spectral flux due to the contribution of such emission.
4. The total molecular gas mass of each galaxy.
5. Estimate the flux ratio of the CO(2 - 1) and CO(1 - 0).
6. The total dynamical mass of each galaxy.
7. The total molecular gas mass fraction for each of our targets.

Through the use of Astrolab servers, Difmap software, and Jupyter Notebooks(Python) to complete the above analysis, we founf that both galaxies were possible
candidates for contiuum emission.

I have included my and my teams paper and presentation.
